# PolyMc
This mod works as a polyfill library of sorts. It replaces modded items/other stuff with vanilla items before they get sent to the client.  

At the current stage 99% of modded items can be made fully compatible with the vanilla client. PolyMC automatically generates a resourcepack to use.
