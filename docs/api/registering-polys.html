        <h1>Registering Polys</h1>
        <p>
            You register Polys in your entrypoint using the PolyRegistry class.
            The PolyRegistry also contains some helper classes, like the CustomModelDataManager that prevents 2 polys using the same value.
            Look at the PolyRegistry class to see the other classes available.
        </p>
        <h2>Item Polys</h2>
        <p>
            PolyMc provides quite good support for items out of the box. There may be some cases in which you want to modify the poly used however.
            In most cases it's best to use the <code>CustomModelDataPoly</code> as a base.
        </p>
        <p>
            *note: if your modded item has damage, replace <code>CustomModelDataPoly</code> with <code>DamageableItemPoly</code>*
            Example: changing the item used on the client
            <div class="c-block"><pre>
<span class="c-red">public void</span> registerPolys(PolyRegistry registry) {
    registry.registerItemPoly(moddedItem, <span class="c-red">new</span> CustomModelDataPoly(registery.getCMDManager(), moddedItem, Items.<span class="c-blue">DIAMOND_SWORD</span>))
}
    </pre></div>
            This will Poly your item as usual, just using a diamond sword instead of a stick. It will automatically allocate a CMD value for it.
